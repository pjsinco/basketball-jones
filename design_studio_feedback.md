**Feedback providers:**

* Eric Coletti

* Tony Thul

* Molly Lloyd

**Quality of feedback:**
Good. The group confirmed a few hunches I had about potential problems.

**Was it fair?**
Yes. 

**Was it helpful?**
Yes. It was nice to meet (and commiserate a bit) with some classmates. I liked the opportunity to discuss the project out loud.

###Issues raised###
*350 might be too many teams* 

* One challenge is making not overwhelming the user with too many teams to choose from. I'll have to see how it goes. If I can pull it off, the density of data, and its completeness, will be pleasing. Nonetheless, Molly suggested limiting the teams to the 64 that made the tournament. That is a good, arbitrary limit if things become unwieldy.

* Another possibility is color coding teams by conference in the parallel coords vis.

*Performance issues with summary data for 5,000 games*

* One of the group had mentioned that JSON files might perform better than CSV, which I had not realized.

* As above, limiting the number of teams might be helpful. 

*More visualization, interactivity on the table of selected teams*

* Someone suggested that a column or two of bar graphs in the table, a la HW1, might be good to include. It might be a good opportunity to add a useful dimension that isn't included in the parallel coordinates chart, such as games won.
